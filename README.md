## What is V Parking

V Parking is aimed at marking parking smart in the University of Waterloo campus.

## Why I develop V Parking

The reason why I develop this app is that parking in the UW campus always troubles my girl, therefore, I made this app to help anyone who needs to park here.

## Functions of the App

**The app shows the real-time status of the four main parking lots by connecting to the UW open data API.**

In addition to these four parking lots, this app provides the information of Visitor, Meter, Short-term and Motorcycle parking lots.

**The information can be viewed on the map by tapping any lot which includes location, restriction, and price.**

**You can record the location of your car and set a parking duration.**

Thanks to my gril for inspiring me with this idea.
